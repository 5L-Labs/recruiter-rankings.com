## 2024-05-22 - Accessibility in Simple Forms
**Learning:** Even in simple Rails forms without a JS framework, small additions like `aria-describedby` and placeholder text significantly improve usability.
**Action:** Always check for missing helper text and aria labels on form inputs, especially when numeric inputs are used for qualitative data (like ratings).

## 2025-05-22 - Empty States in Data Tables
**Learning:** When a search or filter action returns no results, leaving the table headers visible without a body or message is confusing. A clear "empty state" with a call to action (like "Clear filters") provides much better feedback.
**Action:** Always implement a conditional check for collection existence (`@collection.any?`) and render a helpful empty state component or div when the collection is empty.
## 2026-01-22 - Skip Links and Button Styling
**Learning:** Standardizing button styles (like `.cta`) on `input[type='submit']` elements requires ensuring the CSS handles defaults like `border` and `cursor` which differ from `a` tags.
**Action:** When applying link-styled classes to buttons, verify that `border: none`, `cursor: pointer`, and font inheritance are explicitly set.
**Learning:** "Skip to content" links are a high-impact, low-effort accessibility win that should be standard in the layout.
**Action:** Ensure the main content wrapper has a predictable ID (like `#main-content`) to easily target with skip links.
## 2024-05-23 - Basics in POCs
**Learning:** Even "minimal" POCs often miss fundamental accessibility structures like `<html lang>` and skip links, which are trivial to add but critical for compliance.
**Action:** Always check `layouts/application.html.erb` for these two specific items immediately upon entering a new Rails project.

## 2025-01-25 - Empty State Pattern & Card Usage
**Learning:** The `.card` class provides a consistent container for "empty states" and other isolated content blocks, replacing ad-hoc inline styles.
**Action:** When implementing empty states or highlighted content, prefer `class="card"` with minimal overrides (like padding/text-align) over full inline styling.

## 2026-05-24 - Flash Message Styles in Custom CSS
**Learning:** In Rails apps with custom CSS, standard flash message classes like `.alert` and `.alert-danger` are often referenced in `application.html.erb` but missing from the stylesheet, rendering feedback invisible.
**Action:** Always verify that `.alert` classes are defined in the project's CSS (e.g., `web/public/assets/style.css`) and test that flash messages are actually visible.
